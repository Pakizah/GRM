# Grocery and Recipe Manager- GRM
 Our Motto is "Cook Like a Pro in one Go" Cooking is a fun and no doubt an art.
 But sometimes we fail to properly identify the ingredients of a recipe and their amount needed for a particular recipe. 
 We want to provide a Handy solution to the people who are amateur in cooking and grocery estimation. 
 Our Android App helps users to set up their meal plan for a day or a week and ultimately they gets perfect grocery estimates 
 as well as directions for cooking. There would be no leftovers any more. Our Application will also make you able to place a request for
 delivery of your grocery at your door step. 
 
 Modules of this Application will include:-
 Recipes: All sort of recipes with its ingredient list and directions. 
 
 Meal Plan: Here user will be able to add his daily/weekly meal plan.
 
 Grocery List: Grocery list will be generated against user meal plan.
 
 Ingredient Glossary: User can use glossary module to get an idea of particular ingredient, its physical appearance, local name , 
 nutritional facts. 
 
 Submit your own Recipe: User can also submit his own recipe.
 
 Plus would be its synchronization with a delivery app to deliver the grocery to user\'s doorstep.
